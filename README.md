# AtliQ HR Analysis - PowerBI

As part of the codebasics resume challenge, I have worked on this analysis project.

## Problem statement

Atliq is a company in India. They have been in the market for few years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in human resources, Atliq are losing its market share and revenue in the market category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq wanted to incorporate ‚ÄúBusiness and Data Intelligence‚Äù in order to regain their problem in attendance and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights. In this end-to-end data analytics project, I used a real dataset for employee attendance from a company called AtliQ and conduct data analysis in Power BI.

Their HR management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.
